## GitFlow

GitFlow is way to collaborate codes via teams using a method called **branching**. Using branching, each team member is able to work on various aspects of their code in parallel to other aspects. This allows work to be split and each split branch focused on by different individuals. Once branches are completed and ready, the codes can be **merged** back into a master branch prior to release. Once a code is ready for release, it can be cloned and branched off into a develop mode. This code is then run to ensure any bugs are identified and fixed. If there is a need to edit the source code, the respective teams can make the edits merge the branches back into the master branch and a new testable code be branched off to test in development.

## Repository

A repository is the overall **folder** for a project. All of the respective files are contained within a repository including branches, README, requests, etc. A simple repository can be created through Github main page. This is simply a folder which will contain all of the respective parts of the overall project.
