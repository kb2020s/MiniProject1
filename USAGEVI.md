# Usage of Vi

This section explains the usage of Vi with some examples shown in the figures. These commands can be useful to manage the file system.

## cd  
This will allow user to **change the directory**. Instead of, moving and clicking around different folders, this is very convenient approach to change directory. As shown below, the user initially was on home directory, but then he navigated to Desktop using `cd ` command.

## cp
**Copying files** can be done using `cp` command. It copies the contents listed from file#1 to file#2. As shown in the example below, user is trying to copy README.md file and place it under videos folder with name of COPY_README.md. This single line command can reduce time and allows users to copy files instantly.

## pwd
This command **prints out the present working directory** to user. If the user is not sure about the location, then this ‘pwd’ command comes in very handy. As shown below, the user performed pwd command and it provided working directory as following: `/C/Users/bhaga/Desktop/WebSystems/MiniProject1`
